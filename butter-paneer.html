      INSTRUCTIONS <br />
      <br />
      Preparation:<br />
      <ol type="1" class="recipe-list">
        <li>Soak cashews in a hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, preparing ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Then drain and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and blend to a smooth and fine paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews.</li>
        <br />
        <li>In the same blender add the roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Don't add any water while blending the tomatoes.</li>
        <br />
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Making Tomato Gravy:<br />
      <ol type="1" class="recipe-list">
      <li>Melt butter in a pan on a low heat. Add tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil become fragrant.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about 10 to 12 seconds till the raw aroma disappears.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Add the tomato puree and stir well. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes stirring a few times.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Next add kashmiri red chili powder and stir again. Continue to sauté till the oil starts to leave the sides of the tomato paste.<br />
        The tomato paste will thicken considerably and will start coming together as one whole lump. </li>
        <br />
      <li>Then add cashew paste and stir well. Sauté the cashew paste for a few minutes till the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala paste.</li>
      <br />
      <li>The cashew paste will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. So keep stirring non-stop.</li>
      <br />
     </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Making Butter Paneer:<br />
      <ol type="1" class="recipe-list">
        <li>Add water and mix very well. Simmer on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <br />
        <li>The curry will come to a boil.</li>
        <br />
        <li>After 2 to 3 minutes of boiling, add ginger julienne. Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Add julienned ginger and green chillies, salt and sugar and simmer till the curry begins to thicken.</li>
        <br />
        <li>After 3 to 4 minutes, add slit green chillies. also add salt as per taste and ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional). </li>
        <br />
        <li>You can vary the sugar quantity from ¼ tsp to 1 teaspoon or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.<br />
          Sugar is optional and you can skip it too. If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar.</li>
          <br />
        <li>Mix very well and simmer for a minute.</li>
        <br />
        <li>After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes and stir gently. I keep the gravy to a medium consistency. </li>
        <br />
        <li>After that add crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves), garam masala and cream. Gently mix and then switch off the heat. </li>
